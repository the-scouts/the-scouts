# Open source for The Scouts

## Purpose

This organisation is intended to publicly host code useful to volunteers in the Scouts.

## Guidlines

### Repository information
Each repository shoud have
-	a simple and useful name  
-	a user-friendly description  
-	a useful README.md  

### Members
Each member of the organisation should complete their profile, including at least their full name.

### Private repos
By default, all projects in github.com/the-scouts should be public. 
Projects should only be set as private if they contain information that cannot be made public.

### New projects

1. At https://github.com/the-scouts, click '**New**'. 
2. Choose a simple and useful name for the repository
3. Include a brief (one sentence) description of the project. 
4. Set the visibility to "**Public**" unless it needs to be private. 
5. Projects should have a **README** and **LICENSE** as a minimum. 
   The README should instruct the reader how to setup and test the project.
6. We reccommend usage of the MIT licence for most projects. 
   See a [description of the license types](https://choosealicense.com/licenses).
7. Click **Create Repository**.

### Teams

It is recommended to create teams to manage member’s access to a repository. 
Establish separate teams for each access role: one for team admin users; a different team for your developers with write access; and one for users with read only access. 
You can assign the Team maintainer role to an individual(s) who would then be able to add / remove members to the repository’s teams.
